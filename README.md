# simple-quack
Control Denon DN-500AV using its TCP/IP interface.

Currently this is just an interactive console which maps CRLF to LF - which I'm sure a terminal emulator could do. But the plan is to evolve this into part of a home automation system. (see [AmplifierControl](https://github.com/JoachimC/AmplifierControl))

The name 'simple-quack' is because I decided to call my DN-500AV 'duckling'. Its an ugly looking piece of equipment but has beautiful potential - playing music and movies. And I don't plan on doing anything complex with this code - just simple on/off/select source/change volume.
